# Wrangle and Analyze Data
## Introduction
This project points to urge quick data approximately puppy evaluations whereas illustrating progressed information wrangling and visualization strategies utilizing different Python libraries.
I will assemble information from a assortment of sources and in a assortment of designs, evaluate its quality and tidiness, at that point clean it. 
Typically called information wrangling. The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, moreover known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs may be a Twitter account that rates people's mutts with a amusing comment approximately the canine. 
The page has since developed greatly in popularity , with numerous clients sharing its substance and asking their pooches being appraised aswell.
These appraisals nearly continuously have a denominator of 10. in spite of the fact that? Nearly continuously more prominent than 10. Since "they're great dogs."
**Note:** I did not use TWITTER API because they Couldn not support me with an access to developer account.

--------------------------------------

**This project depends on 3 steps , which are :**
* `Step 1:` Gathering Data
* `Step 2:` Assessing Data
* `Step 3:` Cleaning Data ( Define - Code - Test )

## Summary :
To accomplish the objectives of the examination, information have been assembled from diverse sources, counting the twitter as well as other web information. 
The possibilities of Python's pandas library has been utilized broadly on the appraisal and information cleaning parts.
At the end I visualize the data by using specific sights.
